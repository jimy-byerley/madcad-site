			<p class="question">What was madcad created for ?</p>
			<div class="answer">
				<p>
					The main target of this software is mechanical design.
					You can use it to model your parts for 3D printing, or before manufacturing them in the way you want. You can use it to generate parts for finite element meshes, or to visualize big assemblies ...
				</p>
				<p>Mainly for two reasons:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>the extremely high cost of professional CAD softwares</li>
					<li>There was so many operations too difficult or just impossible to make on those softwares, despite their apparent conceptual simplicity</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The first reason prevents many people from 3d modeling. Those people might not be working in a company big enough, or not at a mechanical design office, or just not in a company at all; but could still take a great advantage of having a powerful and intuitive CAD modeling tool at their disposal.
				</p>
				<p>
					The second reason is what made me think to something else than FreeCAD. I wanted something more flexible, extensible and modular.

			<p class="question">Is it necessary to learn python to use madcad ?</p>
			<div class="answer">
				<p>Definitely, at least the basis.</p>
				<p>
					pymadcad is a regular python library, the way to use it is by writing python code. uimadcad is a GUI that helps doing that, but knowing the python language is mendatory since the GUI performs graphically only a small subset of the madcad functions (some operations are easier using GUI tools, like selection or geomtry placement, but others like operation composition, data structure creation, etc would be tedious to implement and use graphically.
				</p>
				<p>
					However you don't need to be an expert of the python language to start with madcad, only a quick comprehension of the python syntax, the basic concepts of if-conditions, for-loops, function-calls and the object-concept is sufficient.
				</p>

			<p class="question">Is it easy to learn madcad ?</p>
			<div class="answer">
				<p>
					If you already know python, the mathematical geometry with vectors and affine matrices, and you already used a 3d mesh edition software like Blender, then yes ! madcad should appear intuitive to you !
				</p>
				<p>
					The reason madcad asks for knowing all this is that ... well, It's hard to offer a way to do 3d geometry, without knowing the true nature of 3d geometry.

			<p class="question">Can I support the development ?</p>
			<div class="answer">
				<p>
					The best way to help is to contribute to the development, you can do it on the github repositories of both uimadcad and pymadcad. Since it is open-source you what you share is shared to the entire world.
